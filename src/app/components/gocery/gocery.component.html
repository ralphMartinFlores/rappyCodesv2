                    Hello! While Go-cery isn't currently available online due to its data not having a designated home, you can still see how it works through a video demo right <a href="https://youtu.be/CRgg6aBafQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> ðŸ‘ˆ
                </p>
                <p>Go-cery is a web-based e-commerce application designed specifically for selling groceries. It allows users to easily explore a variety of products, neatly organized by category. Customers can add items to their virtual shopping carts and proceed to place orders seamlessly.</p>
                <p>Created in 2021, Go-cery was a collaborative effort between myself and partners Bernie Inociete and Euriel John Mora for a class project. During development, I chose to prioritize Vanilla CSS over popular frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize to enhance my CSS skills and build a solid foundation in web development.</p>

                    <h1>Objectives & Goals</h1>
                    <p>Go-cery (2021) underwent a significant redesign due to the identification of missing UI fundamentals that I wasn't aware of initially. During the development of the original project, I was introduced to responsive web design. The redesign aimed to showcase my improved understanding of responsiveness after a year.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I decided to use a framework for this redesign, moving away from plain CSS. Although I initially considered Angular Material, I ultimately chose Bootstrap 5, believing it would offer the most robust and efficient solution for my requirements.</p>

                    <h1>Problems and Thought Process</h1>
                    <p>In contrast to our previous project's approach, I aimed to streamline the display of categories and store products in a single HTML file. To achieve this, I utilized LocalStorage as a crucial tool. The products component now smoothly retrieves item values from LocalStorage, dynamically filling the screen with products when a user interacts, whether by selecting a category or a specific store.</p>

                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                    <p>Through this experience, I developed a newfound appreciation for Bootstrap and its rich utility classes that simplify a developer's workflow. In the past, I often had to create custom class names to achieve a flex display for a div container. Bootstrap, however, provides an elegant solution â€“ the ability to replicate a flex layout by simply adding three classes to an existing div.</p>
                    <p>While I didn't extensively use Bootstrap's grid system in this project, I recognized its immense power and user-friendliness. Its simplicity and adaptability make it a valuable tool for crafting truly responsive layouts.</p>
                    <p>I now understand why Bootstrap is highly acclaimed; it undeniably speeds up the UI development process. I have a deeper appreciation for its capabilities and can see myself incorporating it into future projects for more efficient and rapid interface development.</p>
