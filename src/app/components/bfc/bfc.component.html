                <p>I created this landing page using only HTML, CSS, and JS for the local coffee shop chain, "But First, Coffee." The chain started in Metro Manila and recently opened a branch in Olongapo City.</p>
                <p>As a loyal customer who loves their iced coffee, I noticed our city's branch didn't have its own landing page. So, I thought, why not create one for our local coffee enthusiasts?</p>

                    <h1>Objectives & Goals</h1>
                    <p>Achieving a multi-section landing page was a personal goal of mine. I was also excited to explore designing a dark mode color scheme that aligned with the company's identity, steering away from a basic black shade.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I wanted to understand how to deploy a static website, built with Vanilla HTML and CSS, on a freely accessible hosting service.</p>

                    <h1>Problems and Thought Process</h1>
                    <p>The hero section of this project went through several revisions, but the second and third versions didn't quite meet my satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>To overcome this challenge, I decided to use a new image from Pexels, added icons from Flaticon, creatively overlaid these elements, and introduced new quote bubbles. I applied techniques learned from a recent YouTube tutorial. This approach resulted in a significantly improved hero section that met my expectations.</p>

                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                    <p>Improving the hero sections stood out as a significant learning point in this project. With newly acquired techniques, I now feel more confident in creating engaging hero sections.</p>
                    <p>To enhance my understanding of the BEM methodology, I revisited it for CSS class naming, ensuring consistent implementation throughout the project.</p>
                    <p>A noteworthy achievement was successfully deploying a static site to Netlify, marking my first experience with web hosting.</p>
