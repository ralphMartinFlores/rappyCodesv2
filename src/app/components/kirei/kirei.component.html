                    <p>This project is a valuable chance for me to gain experience in using open APIs. Combining my personal interest in playing the game, I saw a wonderful opportunity to merge two of my passions. As a result, I chose to work with the public Valorant API, seamlessly integrating my love for the game with my desire to enhance my API-calling skills.

                    <h1>Problems and Thought Process</h1>
                    <p>While working with different API endpoints, I faced varying levels of complexity when iterating through the data and presenting it on the HTML page. Some endpoints presented more challenging hurdles. Fortunately, I found a solution by using Angular's KeyValue pipe, which proved to be an easily understandable tool. This pipe effectively resolved the issue of accessing specific data received from the API, streamlining the process, and enhancing my project's functionality.</p>

                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                    <p>In addition to mastering the use of Angular's KeyValue pipe for transforming objects into arrays of key-value pairs for efficient looping and display, I gained valuable insight into how easily Angular facilitates HTTP requests to APIs. This newfound knowledge has expanded my capabilities in working with external data sources, further enhancing my proficiency with the framework.</p>
